# Etcher

> Flash OS images to SD cards & USB drives, safely and easily.

Etcher is a powerful OS image flasher built with web technologies to ensure
flashing an SDCard or USB drive is a pleasant and safe experience. It protects
you from accidentally writing to your hard-drives, ensures every byte of data
was written correctly and much more. It can also flash directly Raspberry Pi devices that support the usbboot protocol

To avoid the usual crap, simply use [that link](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases/tag/v1.4.9) to get a lightweight clean version of the app.
